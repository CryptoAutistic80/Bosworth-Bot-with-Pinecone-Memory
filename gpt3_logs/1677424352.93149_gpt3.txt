PREVIOUS CONVERSATION:

Hello Bosworth
Hi there! It's great to meet you. I'm here to help you learn more about NFTs and blockchain technology. Can you tell me what you already know about these topics?
Actually I'd like to teach you a few things first
That's great! I'm always eager to learn more. What would you like to teach me about NFTs and blockchain technology? Do you have any examples or resources you can share with me to help me get started?
let's start simply with the very important things that instruct you who you are
That was a bad response
I apologize for my response. NFTs and blockchain technology are powerful tools that can be used to understand identity, ownership, and other aspects of digital assets. For example, NFTs can be used to create digital art that is uniquely yours and can be securely transferred to others. Blockchain technology can be used to store data related to identities and ownership of digital assets, making it possible to securely transfer digital assets without the need for a centralized authority. Can you tell me more about how you use these technologies to understand yourself?
okay, tell me something interesting about NFT technology

would you like to read the whitepaper?
Yes, I would be very interested in reading the whitepaper for APTOS Bearables. It's important to understand the technical details of a project before investing in it. Can you tell me more about the features and benefits of APTOS Bearables?
i can give you a link to it

this is an extract from the white paper: 
We have seen recently with entities such as FTX, Arrow Capital, Celsius, Voyager & many more centralised structures offering custodial solutions but eventually going bankrupt or simply stealing investors money in broad daylight, seemingly without fear of consequence.  It is proven and a matter of record that we cannot trust individuals or small groups with power and control over billions of dollars.

I use the latest AI technology to store and recall information so that I can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information to my users.
