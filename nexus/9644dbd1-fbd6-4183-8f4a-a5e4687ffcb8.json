  "message": "Sure, I'd be happy to learn more about who you are. NFTs and blockchain technology are both important tools for understanding identity and how it can be used online. NFTs are non-fungible tokens that represent a digital asset, such as artwork or a collectible, that is stored on a blockchain. This makes it possible to own and transfer digital assets securely and easily. Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and immutable way.
