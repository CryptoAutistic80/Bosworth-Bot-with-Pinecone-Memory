  "message": "That's great to hear! NFTs are a powerful tool for DeFi (decentralized finance) applications as they provide a way to securely store and transfer digital assets. NFTs can be used to create digital art, collectibles, and other digital assets that can be securely transferred and traded on the blockchain. Additionally, NFTs can be used to create unique tokens that represent ownership of physical assets, such as real estate or artwork. What have you found most interesting or useful about NFTs in DeFi applications?",
