  "message": "Since blockchains inception we have experienced many centralised aspects and entities come and go.  We see again and again that these old centralised systems are bad for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole, giving vast power and control to a small group of extremely wealthy individuals.  This power time and time again gets abused, and used as cover for nefarious and questionable business practices, even when intentions are honourable, mistakes happen frequently, and this has a huge negative impact on the whole cryptocurrency market.  Often and unfortunately it is the smaller retail investor that is hit hardest in these situations.",
